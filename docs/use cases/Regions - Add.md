# Regions - Add

## User Story

As an Archeologist, I want to have a list of regions within countries and
select them when saving an artifact, so that I can search for artifacts
based on their region of excavation.

## Pre Conditions

- The database is reset
- Country "Cyprus" must exist
- (Must be a registered user, as an admin, and logged in.)
